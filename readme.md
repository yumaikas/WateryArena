This is a WIP entry for the LISP game Jam 2018


The idea is build a top-down arena shooter with a two-layered combat field, so that you can duck underwateer or jump out of the water to dodge enemy attacks


There is still a *lot* of work outstanding

To run (currently on windows), download love 11.1, unpack the .zip into this folder, and run `make play`
